### About me

Hi, I'm Allie! I'm a second-year medical student enrolled in the University of Washington MD/PhD program in Seattle, Washington. I graduated cum laude from Colorado College in 2021 with a bachelor's degree in molecular biology and a minor in mathematical biology. Following my graduation, I worked at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases as an INRO scholar in the [Ghedin Lab](https://ghedinlab.org/), where I focused on studying the molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.

My interests span various scientific fields, including evolutionary biology, cancer biology, virology, and data science. I am particularly fascinated by cancer evolution and tumor heterogeneity. In my free time, I enjoy hiking with my dog, rock climbing, backpacking, and playing the cello and guitar.
