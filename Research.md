# What I'm Currently Doing
I am officially joining the University of Washington's MD/PhD program! I am over the moon about getting to work with the amazing the faculty at UW and get to spend my next 8 or so years in Seattle. For the next 18 months, I will completed my didactic medical education! I am figuring out how to be a medical student, trying to get involved with the program, and already looking into potential research rotations for the upcoming summer.

## Ongoing projects

<br>

**Early COVID-19 Pandemic in the Caribbean**  
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES, GHEDIN LAB, SYSTEMS GENOMICS SECTION  
Characterize the early COVID-19 Pandemic in Haiti and the Dominican Republic using SARS-CoV-2 sequencing and epidemiological data. We are particularly focused on the variants present in the Caribbean and how/when they were introduced in and out of the Caribbean.

**Predicting COVID-19 Disease Severity Using SARS-CoV-2 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms**  
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES, GHEDIN LAB, SYSTEMS GENOMICS SECTION  
Build logistic regression models of COVID-19 disease severity using patient demographics and underlying conditions with viral clade and single nucleotide polymorphism data.

**COVID-19 Evolution and surveillance sequencing**  
NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES, GHEDIN LAB, SYSTEMS GENOMICS SECTION  
Sequence SARS-CoV-2 samples for various projects to better understand evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. 
Publications: [Epling et al (2023)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36200701/), [Saharia et al (2023)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36695611/)

**Regulation Of MCL1 & TSC1 By Epstein Barr Virus Latent Membrane Protein 1**  
COLORADO COLLEGE, HATTON LAB  
Study how Epstein Barr Virus modulates oncogenic human protein that are implicated in tumorigenesis and may contributed to the formation of Epstein Barr Virus related B cell lymphomas. 

**Regulation Of The Hallmarks Of Cancer By Epstein Barr Virus In EBV+ B Cell Lymphomas**   
COLORADO COLLEGE, HATTON LAB  
Write a review article using the framework of the hallmarks of cancer to research how Epstein Barr Virus can promote B cell lymphoma formation.

**The Bayesian Inference Of HIV Drug Selection Rate In Different Drug Environments**
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, DWYER LAB  
Develop a novel method to quantify the change in select pressure on a pathogen within a host after a change in environment using non-synonymous to synonymous mutation rate ratio and coalescent theory. We then apply this method to study HIV selection after a change in drug therapy.

**Dissection-Enabled Scaffold Assisted Resection: A Novel Technique For Resection Of GI Neoplasia**  
UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, WAXMAN GROUP  
Shadow surgery and compile patient information for a publication of a novel technique for resecting non-lifting or residual GI neoplasia  
Publication: [Stier et al (2018)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29158178/)
