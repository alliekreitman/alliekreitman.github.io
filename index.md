### About me

Hi, i'm Allie! I grew up in Chicago, but have now lived in Colorado, Maryland, and Washington too. Since dissecting my first pig in middle school, I knew that I was interested in medicine. The complexity of the systems and excitement of understanding everything going on in my body every day left me constantly wanting more. As I have met amazing scientists, taken a few more classes, and had the opportunity to experience research first-hand, I have also fallen in love with the problem solving of research and the ways that medicine and research can compliment each other to drive our understanding and treatment of human disease forward.

I graduated from [Colorado College](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/) in 2021 with a major in molecular biology and minor in mathematical biology. After, I worked at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease in the [Ghedin Lab](https://ghedinlab.org/) studying molecular epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. I am now a first year medical student (MS1) in the [University of Washington MD/PhD](https://mstp.washington.edu/) program. 

My current research interests are at the intersection of genomics, cancer biology, and infectious diseases. I hope to use research in large data and genomics to better understand disease evolution and develop new ways to target diseases. Regardless of which direction I follow, I want to find a way to find a niche in patient-oriented biomedical research.
